Hanoi’s traffic was wild but strangely fascinating.\nI had many curious questions, and Anna, the staff, was a delight smart, funny, and charming. Her answers made me laugh and think. Tonight wasn’t just sightseeing. It was real. And I’ll remember Anna as much as the city itself…",

The open-top deck gave great views of Hanoi’s charming streets and historic spots.\n\nIt was hot, but Ngoc – a friendly staff member – offered me a sun hat, checked if I was okay, and reminded us to watch for low tree branches. She was always smiling and made everyone feel cared for.\n\nAfter the ride, she even suggested a local phở place (it was amazing!) and gave tips on hidden temples and a café by the lake. Ngoc truly made my day. I hope to see her again – and come back to Hanoi soon.",

The next day we got picked up at our hotel in the old quarter of hanoi. Ha long bay is famous for it’s pearls and in the first activity they showed us how that process works. Then they brought us to the boat where we had a very good lunch. (vegetarian is an option if you want to) then we had some time on the upper deck to relax and afterwards had the second activity which was a short boat ride or kayaking whit beautiful sights. Then we went back to the boat and went to the biggest cave in halong bay which was extremely crowded, but that obviously isn’t the foult of the agency. Then we went to an island where you could go for a swim or do a hike to a place with beautiful views, which also was pretty crowded. To end the day we had a sunset party on the boat and got very lucky with a beautiful sunset after a cloudy day. Then we got back at the harbour and they dropped us off at our hotel again. All in all it was a very good experience and everything was well arranged. 10/10 would recommend",

There were still plenty of shops with plenty of tables available at the time. I searched it on google map then followed the direction from my hotel and entered through the shops. There will be store employees trying to pull you to their shops but just say no if you don’t want to. Personally I think all shops are about the same. We’re not there for the food anyway although we still had to order something to sit.\n\nIt gets crowded closer to the train time so it’s better if you can make a reservation. I couldn’t find the phone number of the coffee shop though, that’s why I arrived early. Food prices are on the pricier side and there will be peddlers trying to sell their goods while you’re sitting. Worth visiting even when you can’t catch a train.",

I was deeply impressed by the mural’s storytelling and the incredible talent of the Vietnamese artisans behind it.\n\nHowever, the piece is not perfectly preserved. In some areas, the ceramic tiles are chipped or covered in dust. Despite that, it remains a meaningful and impressive cultural work worth visiting.",

This place is a visual spectacle, an explosion of color and creativity that’ll make you think, “Why isn’t my neighborhood this cool?”\n\nThe murals stretch for what feels like an eternity, turning an ordinary street into a vibrant gallery of ceramic art. It’s like the city took a giant arts and crafts project and just went for it. You’ve got everything from quirky designs to historical scenes, all crafted with impressive detail. It’s a great way to turn your daily walk into an art appreciation class.\n\nThe craftsmanship is top-notch, and it’s clear that a lot of love and effort went into this project. It’s not just a mural; it’s an outdoor celebration of art and culture that makes you wonder why more cities don’t get in on this action.\n\nIf you’re in Hanoi and you want to see something truly unique, this place is where you need to go. It’s a colorful, eye-catching experience that’ll make you appreciate how a bit of creativity can transform the everyday into something extraordinary.",

I had the chance to try several dishes like tahu gejrot for 25k, beef gyoza for 30k, bakso Malang for 45k, nasi uduk for 35k, and donuts priced at 6k each.\n\nThe culinary offerings showcased a range of flavors, but the standout dishes were the tahu gejrot and beef gyoza, both incredibly delicious. The event is a food haven, offering a variety of delectable options to suit different tastes. With its lively ambiance, it's a recommended spot to unwind after work, indulge in good food, and soak in the festive atmosphere until the year ends.",

Its intricate design captures the menacing essence of the kaiju, making it a striking photo spot, especially when lit up at night.

Located along Inokashira-dori, just north of the bustling Shibuya Scramble Crossing, Spain-zaka stretches about 100 meters and connects Inokashira-dori to Shibuya PARCO in the Koen-dori area, with stairs near the top of the slope.\n\nDespite its short length, Spain-zaka is an exciting destination, offering one of Japan's rare sloped shopping streets with a distinctly foreign atmosphere. It's the perfect spot to spend an afternoon enjoying a café visit, soaking in the scenery, or grabbing a drink and taking a leisurely stroll. Here’s a list of cafes to explore while visiting Spain-zaka!",

There are tons of people there so it can be crowded getting to the park itself, however, the crowd disperses a bit once you're inside the park. There were several food trucks and stands available for food and drink. I still don't understand why people are getting ice cream when it's cold, but whatever? LOL not really my thing. I went for some hot chocolate instead!\nIt's December 2024, and one of the videos that played on the Snow dome was of a Santa Claus that was kind of sexy? But he was selling pasta? I don't even know. It was great. I had a really nice time, even though it was just me on my own. Lots of couples here, lots of families, lots of people with friends. It seems like a great time with a lot of people, but it's also fun when you're solo. I had read somewhere that you could see Tokyo Tower from this location, but I think it was hidden by a large construction wall. I could definitely see this illumination from the top of Tokyo Tower when I was up there the night before. This is definitely a must-see event if you are here in the fall. It does not disappoint. Will absolutely be back.\nOn that note, Tokyo knows how to do Christmas.\nTechnically, this park is handicap accessible. I walk with a cane, and very slowly. The crowds can be a bit much as you're coming through Shibuya. But, if you're willing to fight the crowds, this is definitely worth seeing. It's positioned right in between Harajuku station and Shibuya station, but I recommend coming from Shibuya station so that you can see the full illuminations all the way up the road. It is a steep hill for those with mobility needs. So, if you are in a wheelchair, maybe bring a friend with you to help get you up the hill. I was quite exhausted walking up it after being on my feet all day, with my cane. And, with the crowds, it can be really difficult to navigate. Come prepared and play it safe and you'll be just fine. 👍",

Standing at 3 meters tall, this detailed Shin Godzilla (2016) statue is Japan’s largest full-body Godzilla figure, perched on a dramatic base that evokes the creature’s destructive nature. Its intricate design captures the menacing essence of the kaiju, making it a striking photo spot, especially when lit up at night. However, its relatively small size compared to the towering buildings around it can feel underwhelming for some, and the inability to get close due to its elevated position may disappoint those seeking creative angles",

The Hello Kitty store had so many cool products. We had such a wonderful time walking down this street.",

As a history enthusiast, I was intrigued by the opportunity to pay homage to a figure as significant as Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, and the statue did justice to his monumental legacy.\n\nThe location of the statue itself is striking, situated in a serene and well-maintained park. The ambiance created by the surrounding greenery provides a tranquil setting that befits the stature of the historical figure it represents. The park also offers ample space for visitors to take a leisurely stroll, relax, or engage in conversations, adding to the overall pleasant experience.\n\nThe statue itself is a masterpiece of craftsmanship. Towering at an impressive height, it captures the essence of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur's strength and determination. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the intricately carved armor and weapons to the facial expression exuding confidence and fearlessness. It truly stands as a fitting tribute to a valiant warrior who played a pivotal role in Sikh history.\n\nMoreover, the plaque and information boards placed near the statue provide valuable insights into the life and achievements of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur. They offer a glimpse into the historical context and significance of his contributions, enabling visitors to better understand the impact of his actions. The presence of knowledgeable guides who are eager to share their expertise and answer questions further enhances the educational experience.\n\nI appreciated the cleanliness and maintenance of the surroundings, as well as the thoughtful amenities provided for visitors, such as seating areas and convenient pathways. The park staff were friendly and approachable, contributing to the warm and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nThe only minor suggestion I have is the availability of more information in multiple languages. While there was English signage, it would be beneficial to have translations in other widely spoken languages, as it would attract a more diverse range of visitors and make the historical narrative more accessible to all.\n\nIn conclusion, visiting the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Statue was an enriching experience that combined art, history, and reverence. The statue itself is an awe-inspiring sight, and the surrounding park provides a serene setting for reflection and contemplation. Whether you are a history enthusiast, a follower of Sikhism, or simply someone interested in exploring the cultural heritage of India, I highly recommend a visit to this majestic tribute.",

The lake offers a pleasant break from city life, especially if you’re nearby and want to unwind. While it may not be as expansive or scenic as some of the more popular lakes in hill stations, it definitely has its own charm.The highlight of Naini Lake is definitely the boating experience. They have a variety of boats to choose from, including paddle boats and rowing boats. It’s an ideal activity if you’re visiting with family or friends. Kids especially will have a great time paddling around and spotting birds around the lake. The calm waters, combined with the gentle rustling of trees around, make it a peaceful outing. Boating here can be a fun and relaxing way to spend an hour or two, especially during the early morning or late afternoon when the weather is cooler.However, Naini Lake is not necessarily a destination you'd plan a trip around. It's more of a \"visit if you’re nearby\" kind of place rather than a must-see attraction. The surroundings can get a bit crowded, especially on weekends, as it's located in a busy part of the city. If you’re someone who loves boating, this spot is worth a quick visit.Overall, Naini Lake offers a pleasant experience for those looking for a quick escape into nature without leaving the city. Definitely recommended if you happen to be in the area!",

        "text": "The Yamuna River Viewing Point, in theory, should be a serene and spiritual location—a place to admire one of Hinduism’s holiest rivers. Unfortunately, the reality is far from ideal. Instead of being a peaceful retreat or a scenic landmark, it feels more like an ignored corner of the city, plagued by neglect, pollution, and poor maintenance.\n\nPros:\nThe only real merit of the spot lies in its intent. For residents of Delhi or those living nearby, it could be worth visiting once or twice out of curiosity or reverence. The historical and cultural significance of the Yamuna holds emotional value, especially for those who grew up with tales of its sacred past.\n\nCons:\nHowever, any sense of holiness or serenity is quickly drowned by the overpowering stench and the visuals of the polluted river. The water is murky, with visible waste floating on the surface, and the surrounding area often resembles a neglected dumping ground more than a public viewing space.\n\nThe lack of civic responsibility from local visitors, combined with near-total inattention by the Delhi Government and municipal bodies, only makes the experience worse. There are no proper cleaning efforts, no tourist facilities, and no structured attempt to preserve or beautify the area.\n\nWhen compared to the beautifully maintained ghats of the Ganga in Varanasi or Haridwar, the contrast is stark and disappointing. Those ghats invite reflection, devotion, and tourism. Yamuna River Viewing Point, sadly, offers none of that.\n\nConclusion:\nThe Yamuna River Viewing Point is a wasted opportunity. It could have been a beautiful symbol of Delhi’s spiritual and ecological heritage. Instead, it’s become a disheartening representation of urban neglect and environmental apathy. Unless major cleanup and restoration efforts are made, it’s hard to recommend this place to anyone—tourist or local.",

Street food vendors nearby add a local flavor—nothing beats enjoying roasted corn or chai while listening to the sound of the waves. The only downside is traffic and parking around peak hours, but once you’re on the promenade, it all feels worth it.",

It was built in 1891 by the British colonial government to supply drinking water to the city of Mumbai.\n\nThe dam is constructed across the Mithi River and covers an area of about 2.1 square kilometers. It has a height of approximately 26 meters and a length of 1,450 meters. The reservoir created by the dam has a capacity of 545 million gallons (2.48 million cubic meters) of water.\n\nThe Powai Dam is surrounded by lush greenery and provides a picturesque view. It serves as a popular recreational spot for locals and tourists, offering opportunities for boating and fishing activities. The dam also plays a crucial role in flood control, as it helps regulate the water flow during heavy rains.\n\nOver the years, the Powai Dam has become an important landmark in Mumbai, attracting visitors with its serene atmosphere and scenic beauty. It is considered a significant source of water supply for the city and plays a vital role in meeting the water demands of its residents.",

Through it, we can sense memories and even catastrophes from our special past.\nThis mural reflects important turning points in history such as the Philippine–American War, the First Quarter storm from January 26 to March 17, 1970, and the struggle against the Marcos dictatorship. Through the murals, the artist pays tribute to and commemorates notable figures in history while also paying tribute to and respecting modern-day heroes (doctors, nurses, police officers, etc.) who led the fight on the front lines against the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aims to reaffirm the pride and identity of Filipinos.\n\nThe bas sculpture on the right wall depict workers in various fields (farmers, fishermen, engineers, construction workers, office workers, etc.) and express gratitude and admiration for their hard work.\nIt was created by Guerrilla, a group formed at the College of Arts of The University of the Philippines (UP), the country's top university.",

Whichever you enter or exit, it is a cool place to visit, buy some souvenir which I did and if you have difficulties paying using your e-wallet, don't get panic, they offer you WiFi for better connectivity especially when you're using roaming. The sellers are really nice and they comprised of small stores of all variety of items you could and couldn't think of. If you have chance, dropby any tea house and they will offer you a cup of tea. After that, you will be captivated with their tea and you will buy.. 😆 frankly the items are really affordable and not overly priced.",

The moment we stepped into the alleyways, it felt like we’d been transported somewhere completely different, each twist and turn revealed something new and unexpected. The shops here were surprisingly unique and didn’t feel as repetitive as in other touristy areas.\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed and had a great vibe overall. The walkways are quite narrow, so I can imagine it gets pretty hectic on weekends. We visited on a Friday morning and found the crowds manageable, even little to some extent.",

It’s not big—just a few alleys—but every wall is alive with murals that change constantly. Some are loud and political, others just wild bursts of color. The art isn’t locked behind glass; it’s raw, textured, and right at your fingertips.\n\nIt can get crowded, especially on weekends when photographers, tourists, and live painters all pack the space. But that’s part of the vibe—it feels more like a living, breathing gallery than a tourist stop. Go early in the morning if you want cleaner shots and fewer people. Good shoes help on the cobblestones.",

This bohemian enclave in São Paulo pulses with the rhythm of graffiti, samba, and soul, transforming alleyways into open-air museums of resistance and creativity.\n\nFrom the iconic Beco do Batman—a world-renowned graffiti alley—to the murals of artists like Eduardo Kobra, Os Gêmeos, and Nina Pandolfo, this neighborhood is more than a photo op. It’s a claimed space where artists shape public dialogue and identity, layer by layer, spray by spray.\n\nHere, art isn’t locked behind glass. It’s alive. It whispers stories of politics, play, love, and local pride. 🌈✊\n\nWhat can you learn here?\n👀 How color becomes commentary.\n🧠 How public space becomes personal.\n💬 How cities breathe through the voices of their artists.\n\n✨ A must-visit for every traveler seeking more than just sights—come for the art, stay for the soul.\n\n#VilaMadalena #SaoPauloStreetArt #BecoDoBatman #OsGemeos #P&C #PostcardsAndCoordinates #UrbanCanvas #GraffitiCulture #ClaimedSpaces #ColorAsVoice #TravelDeeper #StreetArtTour #ArtThatSpeaks",

Conhecido por ser o maior reduto da comunidade japonesa na cidade, o bairro encanta com suas ruas decoradas por luminárias típicas, lojas especializadas, restaurantes incríveis e um comércio efervescente. A cada esquina, é possível encontrar algo fascinante: desde mercados recheados de produtos orientais até templos e espaços culturais que contam a história da imigração japonesa no Brasil. O passeio fica ainda mais especial nos fins de semana, quando ocorre a tradicional feira da Liberdade, repleta de barracas que vendem artesanato, comida típica e acessórios. E claro, não dá para sair de lá sem provar um delicioso pastel japonês ou um takoyaki quentinho! Além de toda essa riqueza cultural, a Liberdade tem um charme especial, onde tradição e modernidade se encontram, tornando cada caminhada pelo bairro uma experiência memorável e cheia de descobertas. 🌸🍣✨",

Foram construídos entre 1908 e 1913 sendo um extenso muro de tijolos que forma arcos e separados por pilastras também de tijolos, seno o ponto mais alto a 11 metros de altura.\n\nNo final do século XIX fortes chuvas provocavam deslizamentos na região onde ficava a  Travessa Santa Cruz entre as ruas Jandaia e Assembléia e devido a isto a prefeitura da época (de  Asdrúbal Augusto do Nascimento) decidiu construir um muro de arrimo, contratando imigrantes italianos.\n\nCom o crescimento urbano e sem os deslizamentos, cortiços foram sendo construídos bem a sua frente e cobrindo a estrutura, sem permissão da prefeitura.\n\nMas nos anos 60 com o projeto de interligação da Avenida 23 de Maio e a recém inaugurada Anel Leste-Oeste começou um processo  de desapropriação e demolição que devido a brigas com os proprietários que demorou décadas.\n\nFinalmente em 1987 a situação foi resolvida e os arcos redescobertos, sendo o jardim a frente deles batizado de Praça dos Artesãos Calabreses (Calábria é uma região da Itália), com o tombamento da estrutura sendo realizado em 2002.\n\nCrédito das fotos mais recentes, que mostram os cortiços: Paulo Tarrinaf (1940-2017, Site São Paulo Antiga).

Foram eles os responsáveis pela construção destes arcos. Desde a restauração feita relativamente recente, pensei que seria interessante imprimir dentro de cada nicho dos arcos 9magens da imigração para São Paulo, destacando os italianos. Considerando que temos excelentes artistas, a reconstituição de cenas com fidelidade não seria difícil. Além disso, uma homenagem ao grupo que ergueu estes arcos. Seroa mais um atrativo turístico, também. Fica a sugestão.",

The main residents were from Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Buryatia. Peddler and fabric brokers set up bases here by opening accommodations and currency exchange shops for transactions at the nearby Dongdaemun Market.\n\nIn 1997, the IMF foreign exchange crisis led to a boom in the area due to the low exchange rate, and Russian peddlers and Uzbek and Mongolian migrant workers who were fluent in Russian flocked there. However, when Russia imposed a moratorium in 1998, many Russians withdrew, and only Central Asian workers remained to open shops and restaurants, resulting in the area's current appearance. In 2022, a theme street creation project was carried out under the leadership of Jung-gu Office, and floors and guides with traditional carpet patterns were installed.",

The octagonal pavilion offers breathtaking panoramic views of Seoul, especially at sunset when the city lights start twinkling. The atmosphere is peaceful, making it a great spot to pause and soak in the beauty of the city.\n\nThe short hike up is refreshing, and if you’re not up for walking, the cable car ride is a fun alternative. There’s a lively energy around the pavilion with visitors taking photos, street musicians playing soft melodies, and couples placing love locks nearby. It’s a wonderful blend of nature, culture, and city life.\n\nDefinitely a must-visit if you’re in Seoul! Just bring a jacket if you go in the evening—it can get a bit chilly up there.",

Sunset views are good, night views with city lights are even better from the wall trail. The wall itself is lit up,asking for a very pretty picture! A plus is that it is not crowded, unlike many of the other attractions in Seoul. A must visit without a doubt!",

Out of nowhere, I saw this massive, Arab-style pavilion—something totally unexpected in Mexico.\n\nUp close, you can see it's mostly made of steel tubing, with intricate decorative elements. The entrance was taped off, but since a group of locals was clearly doing a full photo session inside, I figured it would be fine to step in as well.\n\nThat might have been a mistake. About 15 minutes later, as I stepped out, I was greeted by police officers. Without much explanation, they demanded to see my documents—apparently someone had reported a “suspicious gringo,” aka me.\n\nIn the end, nothing serious came of it. They jotted something down and let me go, but the whole thing left a bit of an aftertaste. So… cheers from CDMX",

Out of nowhere, I saw this massive, Arab-style pavilion—something totally unexpected in Mexico.\n\nUp close, you can see it's mostly made of steel tubing, with intricate decorative elements. The entrance was taped off, but since a group of locals was clearly doing a full photo session inside, I figured it would be fine to step in as well.\n\nThat might have been a mistake. About 15 minutes later, as I stepped out, I was greeted by police officers. Without much explanation, they demanded to see my documents—apparently someone had reported a “suspicious gringo,” aka me.\n\nIn the end, nothing serious came of it. They jotted something down and let me go, but the whole thing left a bit of an aftertaste. So… cheers from CDMX",

I interpret this representation as an allegory of Justice, which only uses force when necessary. It places us in historical context the battles fought in pursuit of recognition for the new country and defense against foreign invasions, but also the urgent need for peace.\n\nThe figure stands on a base with a plaque in the center bearing the National Emblem and the name of Vicente Guerrero. It is guarded by steel bars.\n\nIt is located in the atrium of the San Fernando Church, a historic architectural structure of incalculable heritage value. Every Saturday, a small market is held in this space for the buying, selling, and exchanging of old and secondhand books.\n\nIt is located on Hidalgo Avenue, 600 meters from the STC Metro Revolución station and 190 meters from the Hidalgo station, both on Line 2 of the system.\n\nUnfortunately, it is a space that feels neglected and requires further maintenance.",

Renowned as a hub for the Anglo-Indian community, this neighborhood has been home to generations of families, preserving a unique cultural heritage.\n\nA visit to Bow Barracks is akin to a journey into the past, offering glimpses of its colonial-era architecture and an old-world charm that captivates all who wander through its lanes. The area comes alive during festive seasons, especially Christmas and Easter, with vibrant celebrations that reflect its rich cultural tapestry.\n\nAdding to the allure is the warm hospitality of its residents, who welcome visitors with open arms. Complementing this is the delectable Anglo-Indian cuisine, which promises an unforgettable gastronomic experience. Bow Barracks remains a cherished part of Kolkata, a testament to the city's diverse history and traditions.",

Usually we visit Park Street every year before 25th Dec to immerse in the spirit of Christmas with the beautiful lights all around.. This year however we saw many posts about another Christmasy place in Kolkata - Bow Barracks..\nSo we put on our explorer hats and equipped with Google Maps set off to experience the festivities in that region.. The place is walking distance of around 5-10 mins from the Chandni Chowk Metro Station (gate 5)..\n\nBow Barracks stands in the central part of Kolkata. Today, it is still popular as an Anglo-Indian community, but the truth is people from various ethnicities live here and call it their forever home. As the name suggests, the barracks were built to shelter World War I soldiers. After the end of the war, these boxed apartments were left vacant, so the government turned them into residences for the Anglo-Indian community..\n\nThe red bricked buildings scream of multicultural history and the glittery lights and sparkly decorations welcomed us into a warm celebration spirit.. The place was beautifully decorated with lights, a Christmas tree in middle, the nativity scene exhibited in one side and both sides of streets lined with food stalls set up by the local people selling momos, wantons, noodles, chilli chicken, pork items, cakes, wines, etc.\n\nWe walked under the lights, clicked some selfies and photos, devoured fried wantons, steamed momos and chana cake (a speciality and must have). We also queued in and got our hands on wine cake from the very famous JN Barua (got to know from a few posts that this is a famous one).\n\nAll in all Bow Barracks lived up to our expectations and we truly experienced Christmas Vibes there... Will definitely visit next year as well..",

Seating arrangements have been done on both sides for those who wish to witness the event.\n11 temporary platforms have been erected for the priests to perform rituals during the Aarti. During the immersion days, such as Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Lakshmi Puja, etc., the Ganga Aarti will be temporarily suspended.\nA special team of priests have been earmarked for performing the rituals.\nThe Kolkata Municipal Corporation has taken measure to ensure cleanliness of the ghats on a daily basis and lighting arrangements have also been augmented for better illumination.\nA statue of Ma Ganga in a temporary shrine have been installed at Baje Kadamtala Ghat.\nThe ghat will give you spiritual vibes in between the Aarti and it is so mesmerising.\nVisit the place and be a spectator to this incredible event.\n\nNote: Bike parking will be available but car parking might be a problem.\n\nIt is 25 mins walking distance from the nearest metro station Esplanade.",

Located on the banks of the Hooghly River, the station is massive in scale and efficiently connects West Bengal to the rest of India. It has multiple platforms, both old and new complexes, and is very well-organized considering the sheer volume of people it handles daily. There are clear signboards in English, Hindi, and Bengali which help travelers navigate the station easily. The waiting rooms, retiring rooms, and food stalls have improved over the years and now provide decent facilities. From budget to premium food options and IRCTC food plazas to local snacks, there’s a lot to explore while waiting for your train.\n\nTransport connectivity from the station is excellent—taxis, buses, autos, and even the ferry service are all available right outside the premises. Metro construction work is ongoing which will further improve connectivity. However, due to the crowd, you must be cautious about your belongings. Still, the station is well-policed and secure. Overall, Howrah Station is a blend of heritage, utility, and efficiency—an unforgettable experience for any traveler in Eastern India.",

There's a café, gift shop, and a restaurant (prices are good and rhe food is of excellent quality, they offered live music even on a Tuesday evening). The only downside is the waiting time to go up; we waited for 2 hours, after enjoying the view we needed to wait another hour for our turn to go down the elevator.  We asked if it'd be allowed to go down the stairs since we had 4 children with us, unfortunately it was prohibited to use the stairs. This is the only thing that management needs to revisit; waiting times and crowd management. Other than that it was amazing.",

Let's me do a lap and video, then points out the pyramids, like I hadn't seen them.  Then follows me around for another lap, when another bloke in all black and vest reiterates I only get 5 minutes, families as long as they like.\nI point at my ring and say, I should have brought my wife. No smiles.\nThe two security start arguing as if they think this is ridiculous, but rules are rules and I decide to go down to the glassed area where I am told I can spend as long as I like.\nIt is nice and cool, if a little cigarette smoky, and tinted windows still provide a great view.\nThe burgers are good but they are out of iced tea. 4 stars cause I'm a sucker for a 360 degree view.\nIf you have a choice do it on a clear day, it can get a bit hazy.",

Pretty dramatic for a fountain.\n\nI had a prime view from my hotel balcony, ready for the big show .. and was imagining a giant water jet in the middle of the Nile, shooting water high into the sky .. but nothing. No water, no spectacle, just a very dry disappointment. Turns out, it doesn’t run on a regular schedule and couldn't find anything online about when it's planned to be turned on next.",

The owners of the place are very helpful and cooperative. They contacted me a day before the appointment for coordination. On the same day, they contacted me. They treated me very classy. The room is large and open to the seating and to the kitchen, meaning it is not hidden. The details are comfortable for the eye. It has a bed for two people. The sofa is large and the cleanliness is very wonderful. It has a TV. The windows are large overlooking the garden and the Nile. .. It has all the services, such as an iron and its accessories, a kettle, and the kitchen has an electric stove, a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave, and some utensils.. Tea and water are free upon request.. The garden has a nice seating area, with chairs and a table, and there are birds around you.. Next to you is an Italian restaurant and café, Nello, belonging to the owners of the place. You can order while in your private garden. It has breakfast, lunch, and dinner at your expense (the negative is that there is no privacy, especially if you are sitting in the room and open the curtains, you will be exposed). For the employees and customers of the restaurant), but overall the place is very wonderful and a new experience. Thank you, Professor Karim and Brother Khaled, for the warm welcome and farewell. Thank you to the owner of the idea and place, Professor Ahmed.",

Several boats available with different languages and you can even have a smaller boat for your own private family group trip if you like.\n\nI recommend paying for all the museums and give yourself plenty of time to look around after the boat trip.\n\nI loved the replication of life with their staff showing how it was.  The museums also reflect this too with pictures from the day.\n\nAbsolutely great immersion with scenes from the past and also static displays for those who are used to the more traditional museum style.",

Cruising down the canal in a small boat really added to the atmosphere.  Seeing the different craftspeople at work gave me a new appreciation for their skills. It's a must-see for anyone interested in history or just a unique cultural experience.

The guide was very rude, just kept rushing us. Wouldn’t even stop to let us take one picture or enjoy and appreciate it.\n\nThey then take you through a gift shop which is extremely expensive. I found 1/10th pricing in khan el Khalil marked so please don’t fall for it.\n\nThe museums there are a shame, nothing much to see. Mainly pictures.\n\nWe went there because we were done with all other tourist attractions. This place has no historical significance, no artifacts, just artificial stuff.\n\nI’d still recommend to visit if you have time and nothing else to do.\n\nWe also got discounted tickets from our driver which were 200 egyp cheaper.",

Especially, there is an entire floor dedicated to marriage registration of foreign citizens. Those foreign nationals who want to get legally married in Egypt must have their marriage concluded right there, on the fourth floor. The building even has a separate entrance for this purpose. The officers is very friendly and forthcoming. English spoken and very helpful. At times it can be overcrowded. Let's not forget that Egypt is a very populous country of over 100 million inhabitants. Marriage is a pre-condition to cohabitation culturally. To comply with the requirements, applicants must present super-legalised birth certificate, residence permit and in certain cases an exception to marriage with a foreigner obtained at Ramses street 57. Bring also 5  passport-size photos and copies of these documents to be on the safe side.",

        "text": "Sunqur al-Sa'di Mosque and Madrasa (Mawlawi Tekke): The Story of Whirling Dervishes in the Mamluk Court\nThe Prince Shams al-Din Sunqur al-Sa'di Complex, known today as the \"Hassan Sadaqa Mausoleum\" or the \"Mawlawi Tekke,\" is one of the most magnificent and unique Islamic monuments in Cairo. Located on Souq al-Silah Street in the Helmeya district, this complex tells a unique story that blends the splendor of Mamluk architecture with the spirituality of Sufism, represented by the whirling dervishes' dancing.\nA Tale of Two Eras: From Mamluk Madrasa to Dervish Theater\nThis place bears two layers of history, layered above each other:\n* Mamluk Era (Original Builder):\n* Builder: Prince Shams al-Din Sunqur al-Sa'di, one of the most prominent princes of Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad ibn Qalawun.\n* History: The complex was built between 1315 and 1321 AD.\n* Original Function: It was originally a school for teaching Islamic jurisprudence, with a magnificent domed mausoleum attached for the burial of Prince Sunqur.\n* Ottoman Period (Mawlawiyya Era):\n* Transformation: During the Ottoman period, this complex was designated as the headquarters of the Mevlevi Sufi order in Egypt (followers of the great Sufi poet Jalal ad-Din Rumi), and became known as the \"Mawlawi Tekke.\"\n* Hasan Sadaqa: In the 18th century, one of the sect's most prominent sheikhs, Hasan Sadaqa, was buried here, and since then, the complex has been known by his name among the general public.\nA Unique Architectural Masterpiece: The Samakhana\nThe most important and magnificent feature of this complex today is the \"Samakhana,\" the Sufi whirling theater added to the building by the Mevlevi dervishes.\n* Description: The Samakhana is a circular wooden theater with a unique acoustic design, surrounded by upper balconies for spectators and chanters.\n* Function: This hall was the venue for the famous \"Semah\" or \"whirling dance\" ritual, in which dervishes spin around themselves in a meditative movement symbolizing the rotation of the planets around the sun, on a spiritual journey to connect with the divine.\n* Significance: This Samakhana is considered one of the rare and complete surviving examples of this type of Sufi architecture.\nRestoration and Revival (August 2025)\nAfter years of severe neglect that nearly destroyed the building, the complex underwent one of the largest and most successful restoration projects in Cairo, a collaboration between Egypt and Italy. It was reopened in 2015 in a stunning state of preservation.\n* Current Status: Today, the venue is known as the \"Center for Mevlevi Creativity\" or \"Mevlevi Museum,\" and is open to the public as an archaeological museum.\n* Performances: Most importantly, the Samakhana Theater has been revived, hosting performances by tanoura dancers and Mevlevi troupes, offering visitors a unique and lively experience that combines the beauty of architecture with the spirituality of Sufi performance. Visiting Information\n* Address: Souq al-Silah Street, Al-Hilmiya, Al-Darb al-Ahmar, Cairo.\n* What to See: Visitors can view the remains of the Mamluk madrasa, the mausoleum dome, and the main attraction, the Ottoman Samakhana.\n* Performances: It is recommended to follow the Cultural Development Fund's events calendar for the dates of the tanoura and whirling dervishes performances held there.\nA visit to the Sunqur al-Saadi complex is an exceptional experience, taking you on a journey through the layers of history, from the power of the Mamluk princes to the spirituality of the whirling dervishes, in one of Cairo's most beautiful and revitalized monuments.",

Despite the presence of four parking attendants, the service inside was drastically understaffed with only two servers handling a crowd of 80 people. This imbalance not only delayed the service but also significantly detracted from the dining experience. Furthermore, my request for a simple beverage replacement—a cold cola in place of the lukewarm one I received upon arrival—was unreasonably denied, despite having been accommodated for such a request previously. Such inconsistencies in service and the lack of adequate staffing have unfortunately marred what could have been an enjoyable visit.",

Built in the 15th century, it is located in one of Cairo's historic neighborhoods, brimming with secrets and hidden beauty.\n\n📍 Location:\nAl-Darb Al-Ahmar District, Cairo\n🧱 Historical Overview:\nThe mosque was built by Prince Janim al-Bahlawan, a Mamluk prince.\n\nIt dates back to approximately 885 AH / 1480 AD.\n\nPrince Janim was a close associate of Sultan Al-Ashraf Qaitbay.\n\n🏛️ Architectural Style:\nStyle: Late Mamluk\n\nThe mosque's facade is decorated with intricate stone decorations and Islamic inscriptions.\n\nA graceful minaret with a classic Mamluk design (square base, octagonal body, and ornamented top).\n\nThe dome is small but elegant and is located behind the prayer hall.\n\nThe prayer hall is rectangular in shape, with a marble mihrab and wooden pulpit.\n\n📷 Photography Tips:\nThe stone facade and minaret create a stunning composition.\n\nLook for the Mamluk decorations above the door.\n\nIf the mosque is open, take a photo of the mihrab and dome from the inside.",

It is the only structure of its kind in the city of Karachi and is popular with tourists.\n\nVincent Gimenez S.J. was the Parish Priest of St. Patrick’s Parish when Pope Pius IX initiated the Feast of Christ the King (celebrated on the last Sunday in October) in 1925.[3] Fr. Gimenez was the first to introduce the procession of Christ the King through the streets of Saddar Town in October 1926.\n\nIn 1927 the local branch of the Apostleship of Prayer conceived the idea of erecting a monument that would be a symbol of devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Catholics of Karachi and surrounding areas got together and formed a Board consisting of 26 members. Fr. Gimenez was the President, R.A.M D’Silva was General Secretary and C. S. Lobo was Treasurer.\n\nIn addition, 14 Catholic Associations connected with the parish and representative of the community around 80 persons also went about collecting donations, expediting the work of planning and overseeing construction.",

Stretching along key points of the Arabian Sea, it serves both a functional and aesthetic purpose. Not only does it offer protection from high tides and erosion, but it has also become a popular spot for locals and tourists to relax and enjoy the ocean breeze.\nOn a clear day, the view is absolutely stunning. The rhythmic crashing of waves, combined with the salty air and wide open sky, provides a welcome escape from the chaos of the city. The area is especially pleasant during the evening when the temperature drops and the sea reflects the colors of the sunset.\nHowever, there are areas where improvement is needed. Cleanliness and maintenance can be inconsistent some parts are well kept while others suffer from litter and lack of proper lighting. Safety could also be enhanced in sections where the railing is either low or damaged.\nOverall, the Sea Wall is a great place to take a walk, enjoy a chai with friends, or simply sit and watch the waves roll in. With a little more attention from the city authorities, it could easily become one of Karachi’s top recreational spots.",

The shoreline was impressively clean, contributing to a pleasant and refreshing atmosphere. Numerous huts are scattered along the beach, offering shaded spots for relaxation; however, some structures appeared weathered and partially damaged, likely due to the beach’s age and exposure to the elements.\n\nThe tides were notably strong, with large waves crashing against the shore—an exhilarating sight, though potentially hazardous during the evening hours when wave intensity increases. The beach itself is expansive, covered in fine sand, and provides ample space for recreational activities such as cricket and football.\n\nOne of the highlights was the availability of camel and horse rides, which added a unique and enjoyable touch to the overall experience. Despite certain safety concerns related to the tides, Turtle Beach offers a vibrant and engaging environment. I would certainly consider returning, time permitting.",

The water is clean, the views are amazing, and it's a great place for a peaceful picnic or camping trip with friends. You’ll need a 4x4 or good transportation to reach it, but it’s worth the trip if you enjoy nature and adventure. Best to go with a group and take your own food and water. Sunset is stunning here!",

The variety of restaurants lining the coast promises something for every palate. However, while the views are delightful, the food quality across the board is average at best. The service could also use improvement, as it tends to be slow during peak hours. Overall, it's a decent spot for a casual outing, but don't expect culinary excellence.",

From street snacks to proper meals, it’s a spot many people visit, especially at night.\n\nBut honestly, the overall experience feels just “okay.” The biggest issue is poor management of traffic and cleanliness — the area often gets congested, noisy, and messy, which takes away from the enjoyment.\n\nAnother uncomfortable part is the constant interruption by beggars. Almost every couple of minutes someone will knock on your car window, and it feels very unpleasant, like you can’t sit and enjoy peacefully.\n\nSo while the place is good for food variety, the environment and management need serious improvement to make the experience truly enjoyable.",

This stunning replica of Hyderabad's iconic Charminar is a brilliant architectural homage, standing proudly as a cultural bridge between two cities deeply connected by history.\n\nThe level of detail in the structure is remarkable—it beautifully captures the grandeur and intricate design of the original monument, making it a mesmerizing sight, especially when illuminated at night. The surrounding area, with its vibrant atmosphere and bustling energy, adds to the charm, creating a lively blend of tradition and modernity.\n\nWhat truly impressed me was the way Karachi has embraced this landmark, turning it into a centerpiece that celebrates shared heritage. It's more than just a monument; it’s a symbol of unity, nostalgia, and admiration for Indo-Pak history. Though I’ve only seen it online, I can already feel the warmth and pride it instills in those who visit.\n\nFor anyone in Karachi, Charminar Chowrangi is a must-see! And for Hyderabadi Indians like me, it’s heartwarming to know that a piece of our beloved city is beautifully represented across the border. Hope to see it in person someday!",

The monument features 4 portraits of the Father of the Nation, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, which have been made with Amreli Steels' product - steel bars. The monument was inaugurated by the Honorable Deputy Chairman Senate of Pakistan, Mr. Saleem Mandviwala.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr. Abbas Akberali said “Amreli Steels’ corporate manifesto has always included a consciousness of the environment in which it operates. With the company headquarters and majority of our stakeholders associated with the city of Karachi, we believe it is our duty to contribute to this city in some small way. In order to achieve this we decided to construct ‘The City of Jinnah monument’ as a gift from Amreli Steels to the city of Karachi. Since Jinnah was born in Karachi and resided here after partition as well, Karachi is also known as the ‘City of Jinnah’. In a city where buildings touch the sky, it is a reminder to the public on the importance of solid foundations.”\n\n“The monument is based on industrial art in which Amreli Steel’s rebars have been creatively used to recreate the image of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. It is no coincidence that Jinnah, the founder of the nation, also had a steely resolve about life and a resilience that kept him going despite the many obstacles he faced before he could achieve his goal of a separate nation. This belief and mantra is perfectly encapsulated in his famous quote “With faith, discipline and selfless devotion to duty, there is nothing worthwhile that you cannot achieve”.\n\n“The purpose of it is to celebrate the city of Jinnah and to beautify its landscape. Our earnest objective is to honor the legacy of Jinnah, the man who laid the foundations of our country. We hope that this monument becomes a welcome attraction in the lives of the people who pass by, reminding them of Jinnah’s mission and his dream. The monument will be highlighted at night by creatively using light projections of different colors so it will be beautiful by both day and night. We plan to continue our quest to give back to the city of Karachi in the future by adding to its culture and preserving its heritage.”",

Tucked away from the noise of the city, the place has this calm, reflective vibe that instantly slows you down. I went in the late afternoon, just as the golden light started hitting the lake, and the whole place had this quiet magic to it.\n\nThe open-air amphitheater is the heart of the spot. Even when there’s no event going on, people still gather there — some strumming guitars, others just sitting in small groups, deep in conversation. There’s a strong sense of community, art, and expression floating in the air. It feels like a space where creativity naturally belongs.\n\nWhat I loved most was the mix of people — joggers making their rounds, artists sketching, students rehearsing lines from a play, and families just enjoying a slow evening. It never felt too crowded or too empty, just the right kind of lively.\n\nIt's decently maintained too, especially considering how many people visit daily. Of course, some areas could be cleaner, but it’s nothing that takes away from the charm. I’d definitely recommend going around sunset — you’ll see the sky reflecting in the water, and it's the kind of moment that makes you want to stay just a little longer.\n\nWould I go back? Absolutely. Whether you're into art, nature, or just need a peaceful place to think, Rabindra Sarobar hits the spot.",

The park can be seen very nicely from it. Besides, Police Plaza can be seen on the other side of it. Besides the stairs there is also a ramp to climb up. It has increased the beauty of this park manifold. This is one of my favorite places.",

Known for its proximity to key institutions such as the University of Dhaka, the National Museum, and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Shahbagh Mor has long been a gathering place for students, activists, and citizens advocating for change. It gained particular prominence during the 2013 Shahbagh Movement, when thousands rallied to demand justice for war crimes committed during the 1971 Liberation War, transforming the area into a symbol of national unity and the quest for justice. The bustling intersection is not only a crossroads of traffic but also a melting pot of culture, education, and activism, embodying the spirit of resilience and determination of the Bangladeshi people. Today, Shahbagh Mor continues to be a key location for public demonstrations, cultural events, and social gatherings, reflecting its enduring role as a hub of civic engagement and national discourse in Dhaka.",

        "text": "Review of Silicon City Riverside in Dhaka (Mohammadpur)\n\nThe Silicon City Riverside, located in the Mohammadpur area of Dhaka, offers a peaceful retreat for residents and visitors seeking a break from the city’s fast-paced life. Adjacent to the Turag River, this area has quickly become a popular spot for leisure and recreation, particularly for families and nature enthusiasts.\n\nNatural Beauty and Scenic Views\n\nThe riverside offers a refreshing view of the Turag River, especially during sunrise and sunset. The gentle breeze, open sky, and the reflection of the surroundings on the water create a tranquil ambiance. While the natural beauty is captivating, some areas are impacted by pollution, which slightly detracts from the experience.\n\nRecreational Opportunities\n\nThe riverside features walking paths and open spaces, making it ideal for leisurely strolls, jogging, or simply relaxing. On weekends, visitors often gather to enjoy picnics or spend quality time with family and friends. The area is also popular among photographers for its picturesque setting.\n\nAmenities and Infrastructure\n\nWhile the area offers basic facilities, such as benches and seating areas, the infrastructure is still developing. The addition of food stalls, restrooms, and designated parking spaces would significantly enhance the experience for visitors. Currently, the lack of these amenities can be inconvenient, especially for those staying for extended periods.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe Silicon City Riverside is easily reachable from Mohammadpur and nearby areas, with good connectivity via local roads. Public transport options make it convenient for visitors without private vehicles, though better signage and organized entry points would improve accessibility.\n\nChallenges\n•\tPollution: Parts of the riverside and river show visible signs of waste and littering, which needs urgent attention to preserve the area’s natural charm.\n•\tCrowding: On weekends and holidays, the area can become quite crowded, affecting its otherwise peaceful atmosphere.\n•\tUnderdeveloped Facilities: The area still lacks sufficient amenities for visitors, limiting its potential as a fully-fledged recreational destination.\n\nTips for Visitors\n•\tVisit during early morning hours or weekdays to enjoy a quieter experience.\n•\tCarry your own refreshments and essentials, as facilities are limited.\n•\tAvoid contributing to litter and help keep the area clean for future visitors.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThe Silicon City Riverside in Mohammadpur holds great promise as a serene getaway in the heart of Dhaka. While it offers natural beauty and a relaxing environment, addressing issues like pollution and improving amenities would elevate it to a standout destination for recreation and leisure. For now, it remains a good spot for a quick escape into nature within the city. 👍🔥",

It might be worth to visit during Feb/Mar. However, washroom is not cleaned well but you can use it when needed. The lake water is full of pollution and nature can not clean the water anymore. You can smell weird around the lake area. Road to visit the place is quite challenging for senior people above 60 since road are still in construction and some roads are not even concrete. Most information thing is that you may not find transportation on your way back unless you have your own car. Either you have to take rickshaw or auto, but you may not find Uber on your way back.",

        "text": "Moinot Ghat, known as Mini Cox’s Bazar, offers a scenic escape on the banks of the Padma in Dohar Upazila. The best time to visit is from late afternoon to sunset, when the golden light reflects off the water, boats glide by, and a gentle breeze creates a peaceful atmosphere. You can ride boats or speedboats, or simply stroll along the riverside. Always wear a life jacket while on a boat.\n\nIf you plan to bathe in the river, carry extra clothes. You’ll find light snacks like chanachur, fuchka, coconut water, tea, and fried items available nearby. Several local eateries by the riverside serve basic lunch items such as rice, local fish, chicken, lentils, and mashed vegetables. However, the food quality and overall environment remain average, so stay cautious about hygiene. If you're visiting with family, bringing your own food ensures a safer and more comfortable experience.\n\nVisit the fish market early in the morning for the best experience. Keep in mind that there are no proper toilet facilities at the ghat. Buses and CNGs from Mohammadpur and Gulistan reach Moinot Ghat in about two hours, costing around 150 taka. Personal vehicles can park there easily. It’s an ideal spot for a day trip.",

You can see everything — the Empire State Building, Central Park, the Statue of Liberty, and the Hudson River — all from one place.\n\nThe design of the deck is modern and sleek, with angled glass walls and even a glass floor section that adds an exciting thrill. It’s perfect for taking amazing photos, especially during sunset when the skyline lights up with color.\n\nThe entire experience felt well-organized and safe. Staff were friendly, and the champagne bar added a touch of elegance. Whether you're a tourist or a local, I highly recommend making time for Edge.

Be sure to arrive as early as you can do you can get a spot at the corner of the glass. It gets crowded and stays crowded quickly. I think they should have a VIP section to complete the experience. Glass floor was cool as was the lower level with ping pong tables and other views not accessible outside. Music inside and outside was great.

I visited The Edge on a warm summer day and discovered a great insider tip: instead of paying for the regular observation deck ticket, I went straight to the bar upstairs. That way, I skipped the entrance fee—but yes, you must order something to stay.\n\nTotally worth it! I had a refreshing cocktail with stunning panoramic views of Manhattan, Hudson Yards, and beyond. The vibe was chic but relaxed, and there were fewer crowds than I expected around midday. The glass floor and angled windows give you that adrenaline rush without the line.\nIf you want the experience without paying the full ticket, head to the bar, enjoy a drink, and soak in the views.\n\nHighly recommended for travelers who want the view and a cocktail to go with it!",

Today, the bridge stands as a reminder of its past while also serving as a picturesque landmark in the heart of New York City.\n\nThe location of the Staple Street Bridge is indeed stunning. Nestled among the bustling streets of Manhattan, the bridge offers a peaceful retreat, surrounded by historic buildings and charming cobblestone streets.\n\nVisiting the Staple Street Bridge is a must for anyone interested in history, architecture, or simply looking to explore a hidden gem in the city.

When I found out this place is only catacombs in NYC, I decided to book a tour. I learn so much of history of St. Patrick church that this church is the original before they built St. Patrick 's Cathedral on 5th Ave. I was amazing knowing the history of catholic in New York and mystery behind.\n\nThe underground was great, some people might say it was short time but maybe because I took a tour at the last round so I feel I spend amount of time down there with no rush. Even it only one level underground but the tomb is deeper than that but with the security and lots of reason they completely seal the tomb so no air in and out of the tomb and no one tough inside for centuries.",

        "text": "Very unique scavenger hunt/national treasure search in NYC. Definitely do it with a group since each of us found different clues to progress. You learn quick to look everywhere within about a block of each corresponding clue, on the ground, across the street, or along the walls of a building. We were turned around maybe twice after misreading a clue here or there, and the app/browser had hints to help us find our next location. Can't wait to try another and hoping they create more hunts 🙏",

Convenient location at Pier 40, accessible between the Westside highway if you're driving or public transportation if you're not. A couple blocks west from the train. The staff were welcoming, the orator, comical, and the onboard refreshments overpriced. Approximately a 20oz cup of popcorn, a king-size bag of skittles, and a small cranberry juice ran me $15. I get it and understand a profit needs to be made. Arrive 15 mins or so early as the line starts to pick up. Digital tickets in advance are less expensive, while parking I was told, started at $50/hr when events were ongoing or $20.64/hr on a regular day (something similarly priced, don't quote me) at the same Pier. They leave on time! They don't mess around 🤣 and I read there's no refunds or cross honoring substitute sailings. They do accept tips after unboarding, which we gave generously, though my son felt a way he didn't get a verbal thank you. Just a look of acknowledgment.",

From the moment you step onto the pier, you’re greeted with breathtaking panoramic views of the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Lower Manhattan skyline. Whether you’re visiting during the day or at sunset, the views never disappoint. The upper level offers an elevated perspective and is perfect for photos or just sitting quietly while taking in the scenery.\n\nWhat I love most about Pier 15 is the atmosphere—it’s clean, well-kept, and never feels too crowded. There’s plenty of seating, including lounge-style benches and grassy areas where people can relax, have a snack, read, or even meditate. It’s ideal for a calm solo stroll or a romantic moment if you’re visiting with someone special. You can also see ferries coming and going, which adds to the charm and energy of the area.\n\nIt’s also conveniently located near the Seaport District, so it’s easy to grab a coffee or bite to eat nearby before or after visiting. Pier 15 manages to feel like a hidden gem despite being so central. I always leave feeling more grounded and refreshed. If you’re looking for a peaceful yet stunning spot to enjoy the beauty of New York, Pier 15 is absolutely worth the visit.",

We did the express tour which was perfect timewise as we had a short trip and a lot to pack into two days. Highly recommend!

While most people go to catch the sunset, we got to see the temple beautifully lit up at night, and it was stunning!\n\nThe view of Wat Arun glowing across the river, with cruises gently passing by and lights reflecting off the water, felt like a scene from a postcard. The whole vibe was peaceful, calm, and picture perfect.\n\nEven though we missed the actual sunset, the night view was totally worth it. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a quieter, more serene experience by the river.\n\n📸 Tip: Bring a good camera or phone for some amazing night shots!",

Note that there’s no parking space available so it’s better to get here by public transport or walking. Also this location is not for you to cross the river to Wat Arun on the other side of the river. You should go to Thatien pier for that and it’s only 5-10 minutes walk away and it costs 25 Bht per person or a get daily pass for 150 bht as we got daily to ride ferry around grand place from wat Arun. Great place to get rich experience of other Thai and Hindu cultures and you can sit in garden for relax have some coffee juice around the corner. I definitely recommend to hire a photographer as statues around you and it won’t fit in your phone cam unless your skilled.\n\nNote that there are a lot of Tuk Tuk and taxi drivers nearby on the main road who like to rip off or scam tourists. Just be careful about their offer or try to avoid them if possible.",

The old couple who runs it makes a soup unlike anything I've tasted in Thailand before—it was a real highlight.\n​During the day, it's a completely different vibe. The area is a busy hub for locals, full of people going about their daily lives. I really enjoyed walking around and seeing all the different shops and markets.

It’s hard to know which business to go to for a genuine taste of Bangkok - as most seem to cater for the foreign pallet. Locals don’t hassle you but they will try to get your attention a couple of time to spend with them which is expected.\nThis road is known to be a better experience in the evening when things get livelier and the temperature is cooler.",

It was just a short walk from our hotel, which made it super convenient to explore day and night.\nOne of the craziest and most unforgettable things I did there was trying scorpion, cockroach, and caterpillar worms from the street vendors. Yup — I actually ate all of them! I also had grilled crocodiles and tons of other delicious street food. It’s a food lover’s paradise, especially if you’re into bold, adventurous eats.\nI also got a traditional Thai foot massage right there on the street, surrounded by music, laughter, and the buzz of travelers from all over the world. The vibe was unbeatable — energetic but laid-back at the same time. It truly felt like the soul of Bangkok.\nIf you’re visiting Bangkok, don’t skip Khao San Road. It's chaotic in the best way and packed with culture, flavors, and unforgettable moments.",

As soon as I stepped onto the skywalk, I was greeted with panoramic views of the Bangkok skyline that were nothing short of stunning. The glass floor adds an exciting thrill, giving you the feeling of walking in the sky — definitely not for the faint of heart, but incredibly memorable.\n\nThe area was well-maintained, and the staff were friendly and helpful, ensuring everyone felt safe and comfortable. Whether you’re a local or a tourist, this is a must-visit attraction to truly appreciate the beauty and vibrancy of Bangkok from above.\n\nHighly recommended for photographers, adventurers, or anyone wanting a unique cityscape experience. I’d love to visit again at sunset for that golden-hour magic!",

Thankfully, I had prebooked my tickets—no queuing, no hassle. This was my third time ascending to 314 metres for a panoramic morning view of Bangkok. Fewer people, more peace. Though the heat was intense, it offered a completely different vibe from previous evening visits.\n\nThe lift to the 74th floor Observation Deck took just 50 seconds—so fast that some guests even felt their ears pop. Once at the top, there is a massive space to roam and snap photos. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful, patiently guiding through the experience. I was even able to store my belongings for free—just remember to keep your ticket to retrieve them later. Pack light so you can move freely around the deck.\n\nOn the 74th floor, you can enjoy drinks, use the toilets, ice cream corner, beverages, and souvenirs. It’s a great spot to pause and take in the view before heading even higher.\n\nOn the 78th floor, the glass tray suspended over 300 metres above Bangkok is absolutely breathtaking. You’re not allowed to bring your phone onto the tray, so plan your shots from the side—sun glare can obscure the view beneath the glass. From here, you can climb even higher to the city’s highest accessible point. Each level offers cosy seating and jaw-dropping views. There’s even a bar and coffee shop to unwind while soaking it all in.\n\nThe ‘I-Tilt’ challenge is located on the 75th floor, the I-Tilt lets you lean out from the building’s edge at a thrilling 65-degree angle for two minutes. At 296 metres above ground, it’s the only outdoor platform where you can truly feel the wind on your face. You’ll wear a watch to monitor your heart rate—definitely not for the faint-hearted or those new to high-altitude adventures.\nComplete the challenge and you’ll earn a Certificate of Courage—proof that you looked up,  stared down the sky and didn’t blink.\n\nOn the way down, stop at Level 4 to explore the Mahanakhon Skyverse—a stunning interactive digital museum with nine immersive zones. Afterward, you’ll pass through the shopping counters and arrive at the lobby, where the TukTuk Quest awaits. Don’t miss the ‘Great Wall of China’ VR challenge—it’s exhilarating and fun!\n\nFrom the glass-floor skywalk to the adrenaline-pumping I-Tilt, the futuristic Skyverse, and the playful TukTuk Quest—this experience is packed with unforgettable moments. If you’re craving adventure and ready to challenge your limits, this is a must-visit destination.",

The tower is in a neighborhood with other high-rise buildings, which creates amazing panorama. Skywalk can raise the heartbeat with the first step but you should definitely jump on!! The beverages are extremely expensive, as expected. Small beer-280 BTH. You can not bring a backpack even of small size upstairs, but there are free storage bins. The \"laser show\" on the 4th floor is also very nice, but it was extremely crowded at some spots. In total, there were 9 rooms, each slightly different.  We didn't buy the tickets upfront, and there was no queue. The basic one is 1200 BTH.",

For 200 baht, you get a drink and some chicken to feed the cats; a great little package. The space was clean, tidy, and filled with plenty of adorable cats. One of the unique features of this café is that, in addition to the cats, they also have a caracal and some prairie dogs, which makes for an unusual and memorable experience.\n\nHowever, I did have some concerns. A noticeable number of the cats seemed unwell, with runny noses, eye or ear infections, and one in particular appeared to be struggling to breathe due to a severely blocked nose. We visited around 9 p.m., and while the staff were kind, not many spoke English fluently at that time, so I couldn’t easily ask about the cats I was worried about.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my time there, but I left feeling concerned about the health of some of the cats.",

With signs in Japanese and rows of Japanese restaurants, karaoke bars, and izakayas, it feels like you've wandered into a corner of Tokyo's downtown. At night, the neon lights shine, and the area bustles with tourists, expatriates, and Japanese people working there, creating a sense of security despite being in a foreign country. However, with its many bars and clubs, the area also has a strong adult social atmosphere, creating a lively yet slightly mysterious atmosphere. There are also local food stalls, and the natural fusion of Japanese and Thai cultures is fascinating, making even a short stroll worthwhile. For travelers, this street offers a special experience of experiencing Japan in a foreign land.",

It is a small but attractive building to view.\n\nThe chapel was closed during our visit in July so not sure if you can enter and see the interior of the Chapel of Iver Icon of Our Lady.

This collegium sentenced more than 30 thousand people to death: military personnel, engineers, scientists, cultural and artistic figures.

So its big. It was commissioned by Empress Anna Ivanovna and cast between 1733 and 1735 by Ivan Motorin and his son Mikhail. But as with the best laid plans of men and mice it cracked during a fire in 1737 and has never been rund. So don't hand around for the ringing ceremony.",

This is believed to be the largest bell in the world at over 200,000kg in weight.\n\nThe bell was made between 1733-35. It stands at 6.14 metres tall and measures 6.6 in diameter. You can appreciate the scale and size of the Tsar Bell by standing near it for photos and while viewing it from 40+ metres away where you can see how much larger it is than the people posing for pictures in front of this monument. Note, the broken section of the bell. It rests beside the bell and is equally impressive in size.\n\nNote: Another similar large scale item is the enormous Tsar Cannon located not far away on the other side of the Ivan the Great Bell Tower. It is worth having a look-see as well.",

The fountain has four cascades, it is located in a bowl with a diameter of 50 meters and is illuminated by a thousand LED lights, the height of the central composition is 11 meters.\n\nThe sculpture depicts a plot from ancient Greek mythology: Zeus, in love with Europe, the daughter of the Greek king Agenor, came to her in the form of a beautiful bull. The girl began to play with the bull, sat on his back, and the bull took it and ran into the sea, taking the girl with him to the island of Crete, where he married her. The girl bore him sons. The sculptor shows this moment by intertwining metal pipes, in which he depicts the head of a giant bull and a woman in his horns. The fountain has 5 bowls, located one inside the other, which cascade down from the sculpture. There are 48 columns nearby, on which the flags of European countries flutter.",

        "text": "The house of the \"Russia Insurance Company\" is two blocks of apartment buildings built in Moscow in 1899-1902 for the \"Russia\" insurance company according to the design of the architect N. M. Proskurnin. They are located at the address: Sretensky Boulevard, 6/1, buildings 1 and 2, and occupy the entire block between Frolov, Bobrov and Milyutinsky Lanes. They have the status of a cultural heritage site of federal significance. Throughout the Soviet era, communal apartments were housed in this house. I have repeatedly visited two of my acquaintances whose apartments were located in the entrances facing Bobrov Lane. What can I say - before the revolution, the building was steep. The ceilings in the apartments were 5 meters high - you couldn't change a light bulb in a chandelier without a stepladder. Almost every apartment had a fireplace and a back entrance from a huge kitchen with a separate stairwell so that the servants did not cross paths with the masters. One of my friends' parents made a mezzanine in one of the rooms, where they arranged a nursery. And it was a separate huge three-room apartment. I was still in school and when I came to visit my friend, I was delighted with this solution. It seemed to me then that it was incredibly cool. I lived in an ordinary panel high-rise building. The second friend lived in a communal apartment with seven rooms, two of which belonged to his parents. And even this option was very good, since the house was located in the very center and 50 steps from the metro.",

Enamored of Russian folklore fabulous epos, he created not only the buildings but also the furniture and everyday objects. What made his creations unique was a sense of fairy-tale, with symbols and history he found in folk art. Malyutin also authored the most famous Russian souvenir– Matryoshka doll.",

The entrepreneur built an apartment building in 1907, one part of which was intended for tenants of talented artists and performers, the second for his own residence. In 1922 Pertsov was arrested and the house was nationalized. Leon Trotsky and other military leaders lived in the mansion. Since the 1970s, GlavUpDK of the Russian Foreign Ministry has been located.\n\nThe attraction is included in many walking tours of the Russian capital.

The square arose in the 1790s, after the demolition of wooden buildings. It is located in the Central Administrative District of Moscow between Tverskaya Street, Tversky Proyezd and Stoleshnikov Lane.\n\nThe monumental buildings of the square are a whole gallery covering different historical eras that have sunk into oblivion and exist today. Thanks to the preserved historical flavor, Tverskaya Square has a worthy place in the list of sights of the capital.",

When I said I only understand a little Spanish, she yelled and kept repeating the same phrase. If you say it louder or keep repeating, it does not change my language proficiency. The rest of my visit in Buenos Aires has been great. I'm disappointed this was one of my last experiences.",

I have never experienced this kind of rudness of a bus driver in life.\nHe nedes to get fired together with his college who checks the bus tickets because we are the ones who are paying them and not the other way around.\nThis was on the 17th of September 2024 the bus who ended the tour on station 10 at 19:00 PM.",

My suggestion is tour the whole place don’t get off and if you have a point of interest hop off spend 30 minutes then hop back on since the buses pass every 30 minutes. I was able to tour twice since it was for 24 hours the next day rerouted and went straight to the location I wanted and just walked back to my hotel. I say pre-plan so that you make your moneys worth. Also they are one of main locations to purchase tango tickets all places prefer cash payments but if you must credit cards are accepted with a 15-30% service fee. Am Sharing video of places you’ll see in the tour enjoy and take plenty of photos we sat front row great view but pretty warm in the cabin. You also get ear phones tour is various languages.\n\nThey have several stops that are easily to navigate however there some of the stops that aren’t super clear that’s where you take the grey line; however, on the link we received provides you map of all stops in case you get confused or unable to find the stop.",

The work, a classical-style bronze replica, represents the Roman emperor in a solemn attitude and was placed alongside other figures from the ancient world, such as Julius Caesar and Caesar Augustus, in the so-called Sculpture Walk of the Roman Republic. This initiative was part of a cultural policy promoted by Benito Mussolini's regime, which sought to spread the grandeur of the Roman legacy in countries with strong Italian immigration, such as Argentina. Since then, the statue of Trajan has adorned Plaza Lavalle, in front of the Palace of Justice, as a symbol of the ideal of a just, civilized, and militarily competent ruler.

The original base was made of marble and reproduced Trajan's Column in Rome from 112 AD. The current base is concrete. The rule of Emperor Trajan was marked, among other things, by the construction of enduring buildings and monuments in Rome such as the Trajan Forum, Trajan's Market and Trajan's Column. He was emperor between the years 98 and 117. His legacy, unlike other rulers, was appreciated. Remembered along with Augustus as the greatest emperors. He received the title of Optimus Princeps (The Best of Princes) by the Roman Senate. His legacy was so great that when a new emperor ascended to the throne, the Senate expressed the following wish \"Felicior Augusto Melior Traiano\", that is, \"May he be luckier than Augustus and better than Trajan\", since they symbolized the heights of the imperial stage.",

Seeing everything in the way it was, was a new for us. I like the fact that SAFETY was highly considered. It was a fun tour and I recommend. Also our tour guide Japhet was really good! He helped with taking pictures and he helped us to try posing in some ways that ‘turned’ well! They are flexible too so that if you miss your time slot you can join another tour set. We had to wait a while cos we missed our slot due to traffic. At the time of waiting you can walk round the landmark centre and look around and grab a bite!",

        "text": "As a lover of museum and galleries, this spot was just okay. The tour guide was great and very knowledgeable about the history and songs of Fela Kuti. A musical political activist. However, it would have been nice to have some of his music playing in the background for those who knew little about this Nigerian legend. Also he was the only one working so he was up and down between the tour. It's definitely a good stoo if you're keen to know about Fela without reading it up on a Wikipedia page.\n\nThere's a rooftop bar where one can have drinks and souvenir shop at the bottom if you need a cool tee. They do have a better opportunity of living up the spaces as they feel dead and decaying. Maybe better lighting and a paintwork. But that's just my opinion.\n\nFor a die hard fan, I hear you could come at night and experience music and dance with other Fela fans. (to be confirmed, I'd call to ask when they host these festivals)",

The place holds a lot of memories and history about the legendary musician.\n\nA fee of 1,000 naira is being collect as entrance fee and a guide takes people around to show what the place is about and narrates the history about the place.\n\nWe were taken around alongside some other tourist and we were show some of Fela’s ablum, his rooms which houses his personal items such as his saxophone, his clothes.\n\nWe were informed by the tour guide that his clothes have been there since his demise and we were also showed his shoes too.\n\nHe was such a stylish musician I can say.\nWe  were also taken upstairs, more like a rooftop where we saw a very big local pot called (ikokorin in Yoruba) which means “iron pot” in English.\n\nSome souvenirs are also called on the premises at different rates such as t-shirts, caps etc.\n\nIt is a nice place and it holds a lot of history.",

However, the tour guide didn't know the history -- basic things like when did slavery end! I also know a lot about the history and knew when the truth was being stretched but the tour guide kept arguing with me that they've been working there for 10 years so I should just \"trust them\".... 🙄 it's sad. So because of that we decide to downgrade from the N10k tour package to the N3k package rather than leave because we had already traveled from so far and I wanted to support the center.\n\nThe place needs work, but it's a gem in the rough. I really hope the management continues to make an effort to revam this place because it's such a great opportunity and good for the culture. We learned that the family single handedly saved some buildings from demolition so kudos to them. They also have a very nice and simple hostel available which is a lovely idea. Also found out that there are free Portuguese classes every Saturday for kids. These things should be highlighted.\n\nMessage to the owner: I congratulate your efforts, a civilian providing such a vital but neglected public service to Nigerian cultural heritage. Keep on going and don't let your vision decay!\n\nEasy, cost effective recommendations:\n- Improve your publicity--it's hard to even know this place exists and what it offers.\n- Encourage your tour guides to know what they are talking about. Assuming you pay them, so they need to do their job properly.",

That’s right, you have to pay to sit down and there’s no room for you to put your mat at the shore because the sitting arrangement is literally to the bank of the ocean. Asides that, you can’t even stand in peace because there are people riding horses by the shore so you constantly have to run to give them space.\nThe worst past is the horses poo. They poo right on the shore where people are trying to swim or just put their feet’s in the water. It’s dirty and disgusting.

I must say, a good job is being done preserving the natural state of the wildlife, swamp and shrubbery. The canopy walk is one of the highlights, it is well maintained and very exciting to say the least.\nI also like that there is a park where you can unwind at the end of the experience with family and friends. There are a lot of activities ranging from giant board games, mini basketball court, tropical drinks and more.\nIt is worth every penny and I'm honestly surprised it is not priced more.",

This bronze statue is situated within a small roundabout / park is one of the new attractions added to South Bangalore. Situated near Ramakrishna Math, Basavanagudi, it draws huge number of visitors to the bronze statue. The park is well maintained and clean. Only problem is that of the noise from vehicular traffic. It would be next to impossible to sit in calmness or even meditation. Fencing all around this enclosure has been done and is secured by a gate too. Parking has to be done elsewhere and you will have to walk it up to the statue. Still,  yowe recommend you do. Cheers!",

Located just a short drive from Bangalore, it offers a perfect weekend getaway from the city's chaos. The drive itself is quite scenic, and once you arrive, the calm waters surrounded by lush hills create a truly serene atmosphere.\n\nGreat spot for photography, picnics, or just relaxing by the water. If you arrive early in the morning or around sunset, the views are especially magical. There are a few trails around the area for those who enjoy light trekking or exploring.\n\nJust a heads-up: swimming is not allowed, and it’s best to pack your own snacks or water, as there are limited facilities nearby. Respect the environment—please don’t litter!\n\nOverall, Manchanabele Dam is a peaceful and beautiful place that’s definitely worth a visit if you’re in or around Bangalore.",

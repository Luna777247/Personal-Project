# Climate Change Impact Simulation using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)

## Project Overview
This project simulates the impacts of climate change events such as heavy rainfall, flooding, or drought on communities and urban areas using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM). The simulation models how agents (representing individuals, households, or communities) respond to climate events and their cascading effects on society.

## Objectives
- Build ABM models for climate change scenarios (heavy rain, flooding, drought)
- Analyze impacts on communities/urban areas
- Demonstrate understanding of complex system simulations

## Technology Stack
- **Platform**: GAMA Platform (preferred) or NetLogo
- **Language**: GAML (for GAMA) or NetLogo language
- **Data**: Climate data, population data, geographical data
